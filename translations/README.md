# Translations

When adding a new translation:

- Create a new sub-directory in translations
- Copy the files from translations/en to the new sub-directory
- Add the new language to collector.rb (line 138)
- Translate
- Middleman/livereload should note any changes to translations and
  refresh the webpage for you

## Converted

The converted subdir contains the TryRuby R2 spanish translation, converted
into individual markdown files.

The numbering is in principle the same as the English version. But since I
modified the lesson content quite a lot it is not the same any more.
